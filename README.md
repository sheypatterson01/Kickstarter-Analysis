## Theater Outcomes by Launch Date
### Overview
In this project I utalized data from Kickstarter table to determine the outcomes of the Theater subcatagory based off of launch dates. I compiled the number of each successful, failed, and cancled campaign and created a grand total of each. After this I created a line chart to plot each outcome.

### Explanation
As you can see in this chart, there was a large spike in successful campaigns in the month of May, and then a steady decline in the following months. 
### Possible Limitations 
The only real challenge presented with this data set is that it is limited. Yes, it shows a spike and a decline across several months, but it gives you zero insight as to why these take place. 

## Outcomes Based on Goals Chart 
### Overview
In this secondary project I utalized the same Kickstarter table, but this time used it to determine the outcomes based of of goals.

### Explanation 
In this chart we see the results of the percentages of successful, failed, and canceled campaigns based off goal cost. 
### Possible Limitations
I did not personally run into any issues with this data set, but with that being said, I feel as though including the canceled catagory with this specific set of data was pointless. There were no canceled campaigns in the theater subcatagory, so it seems like wasted time.
